1. Provide a small explanation for each of the outputs, 
the purpose of the override, and when you observed it to print.


Constructor is the first one to be called.

Then the render is called

componenetDidMount runs after the render.

Then tick is called to change the value of the clock
and render is called to render it to the componenetDidMount

The last two is looping every 1 second as stated in 
the componenetDidMount.

Tick --> Render --> Tick --> Render
